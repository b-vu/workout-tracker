# Workout Tracker

## Description
    
This application allows you to track any workout you perform. By entering your specific workout, Mongoose enters your workout information into a MongoDB database. This project also stores and presents your weekly workouts in 4 easy-to-read, helpful graphs. Now you have a simple, friendly web application to track your workouts every week!
